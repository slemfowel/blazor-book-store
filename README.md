## What is it?

BookStores is a getting started template for .NET developers. It takes care of authentication and authorization so that you can concentrate on your business logic. Also it has some sample pages showing how you can bridge the gaps between Database + API + UI layers in the project. If you are looking for a head start then you are in luck.

## Architecture

It uses SQL Express for storing the data, ASP.NET Core Web API for business layer and Blazor Server App as a client. The Web API project uses Entity Framework Core for performing database related operations.
